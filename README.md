# Sentiment-Analysis---ML Kickstarter-Project
This project involved writing the code and testing the model on Python for my dissertation using natural language processing. The study compromised 80 excel files being cleaned and pre-processed which then enabled me to create a model on Python to predict Kickstarter campaign success through sentiment analysis (Machine learning) based on crowdfunding project blurbsâ€™. In addition, regression analysis was implemented to determine which machine learning model provides the best prediction and accuracy percentage for this type of study. As a result of this study the most successful and failed blurbs (descriptions) associated with each category on the platform was produced to provide a guideline for future fund seekers to adhere to, which was unprecedented in this field of research.
